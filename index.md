## About

\quotation{
    The UKRI CDT in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Advanced Computing provides 4-year, fully funded PhD opportunities across the broad areas of particle physics and astronomy, biological and health, and mathematical and computer sciences. Training in AI, high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance data analytics (HPDA) plays an essential role, as does engagement with external partners, which include large international companies, locally based start-ups and SMEs, and government and Research Council partners.

    The CDT is built upon longstanding research and training collaborations between the universities of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea. In addition, Supercomputing Wales and the University Computing Academies provide bespoke support via Research Software Engineers and access to HPC facilities in a coordinated fashion. We work closely together with the STFC CDT on Data-Intensive Science.
